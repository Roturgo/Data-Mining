The main concept behind TF-IDF is that within a specific document, the more frequently that a word occurs then the more relevant that term is to that document (that's the Term Frequency part of TF-IDF).  However, if that same term occurs across multiple different documents then it may be less relevant overall and could simply be a commonly-occuring word (that's the Inverse Document Frequency part of TF-IDF).\n",
    "\n",
    "TF-IDF for data mining involves applying scoring to terms to weight them higher or lower in relevancy when observed within a document and also applying scoring to those terms as observed throughout multiple different documents.  Your ultimate goal with TF-IDF is to find relevant (high-scoring) words that will do a good job of summarizing an individual document."
